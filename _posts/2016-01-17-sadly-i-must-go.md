# Sadly, I must go, but I may be back

This platform is not mature enough for me yet. In the [beer hand][0] post, the order of the image and text got mixed up and I could not fix it even though I jiggled a lot of stuff around. I also sent an email to support but they did not reply. Granted, it was Friday and I sent 3 emails that night and they got back to me on 2 of them, but then again, none of their replies actually fixed any of the issues I had.

Then, yesterday I published something else but (I think) because I forgot to include a title before posting, there was no link to the post's page. I added a title, but apparently by then it was too late for the AI to add a link to the page. What made it suck even more was that only part of the post appears on the home page feed.

I understand that The Grid is supposed to still be in beta, but all I really want to do is write and have it appear in a decent looking website. Their AI is really not getting it done for me and I am unwilling to spend too much effort trying to figure out how to work around the issues they have, especially around basic functionality that is broken. It doesn't matter how pretty the website design is if my shit isn't even showing in it, so I think I shall have to complete the crude engine I started hacking up some months ago but abandoned to wait for my The Grid account to be ready. Look for future posts [there][1]! I may check back here a month or so later to see if things have improved.

\[Edit: Apparently, publishing this post makes the previous one accessible from the home page, but the link is some crap like [http://blag.attaboy.me/8dd59615-deda-4e19-b08f-b72a7f6682f6/][2].\]
