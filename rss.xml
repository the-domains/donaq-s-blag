            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sadly, I must go</h1><p>This platform is not mature enough for me yet. In the beer handÂ post, the order of the image and text got mixed up and I could not fix it even though I jiggled a lot of stuff around. I also sent an email to support but they did not reply. Granted, I sent 3 emails that night and they got back to me on 2 of them, but then again, none of their replies actually fixed any of the issues I had.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>my lazy arse can blag</h1><p>I think the decision for the modest goal of blagging at least 100 words a day was a good one. It is very achievable, so there is no pressure and hence very little resistance against starting this task. Hey, my subconscious usually says, let's just bang out 100 words and get on with our lives. How hard can it be?</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Let's get this bitch on the road</h1><p>This blag is currently hosted on The Grid, which is supposed to design your site by artificial intelligence. O RLY?? This is obviously very exciting to a programmer such as myself, for several reasons.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ace58c25cb09c56941f19a198ea39fd1f4f3ca24.jpg"></article>]]></description>
