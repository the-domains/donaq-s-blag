In another life, I used to hold the conceit that I could write pretty well. I had a [Blogger][0] account with a modest following and I was pretty proud of it. I am not going to link my actual defunct blog here, because I cringe a lot now when I read some of my old posts. However, I have also not deleted the blog and, given the title of this one, it should not be hard to find, so have at it if you are curious.

So, what is this blog about? Honestly, I do not have a theme. As I said, I used to fancy myself as quite a talented writer, but then life and work got in the way and I stopped writing. I did still have ideas for stories, though, and I have arbitrarily decided that the time has come for me to start flexing my creative muscles again. Deal with it, world.

Bravado aside, while I think my story ideas are awesome, my writing skills have probably atrophied to the point where I would be unable to do them justice. Hence, I have decided to start developing them by blogging. Unless I happen to be busy with work, I will write at least 100 words every day here. Ambitious, I know, but one has to start somewhere. So those were my first 100 words.

p.s. Yes, I know there were more than 100 words in there, but

1\. genius should not be restrained, and

2\. this ain't Twitter.
