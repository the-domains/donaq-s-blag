# Let's get this bitch on the road

This blag is currently hosted on [The Grid][0], which is supposed to design your site by artificial intelligence. O RLY?? This is obviously very exciting to a programmer such as myself, for several reasons.

1\. I have no taste and am extremely [lazy][1], but I wanted to create a website.

2\. AI is just generally very interesting to me, and I was excited to see how this one would perform.

And that is why, almost a year ago, I impulsively paid about a hundred bucks for an account with a product that did not even exist yet. About two months back, I finally got a beta account, and yesterday (hey, I did say that I was lazy) I finally __got off my lazy arse and started actually using it. Yes, I am a slow starter, but when I do get started, I tend to follow through...

Or sometimes not.

I am also very inconsistent. But hey, at least I am _reliably_ inconsistent. That is something, right?

Anyway, in the interest of putting this AI through its paces, I shall try to stick a couple of arbitrary images in this post. Let us see how it handles it.
![Mmm... beer...](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e707d4b1-a854-4608-b5e2-2a530ad82e03.jpg)

That's me, in the [office][2]. 

As you can see, I was born with a physical defect. Instead of proper human hands, I have beers. They used to laugh at me in school when I was younger and they were just Jolly Shandy hands, but when we turned 18 and they matured... well, let's just say that my beer hands became really popular really fast. It was a little depressing, in a way. There were a couple of girls who used to be really mean to me, but suddenly, all they wanted to do was to hold my beer hand and chug from it. At one point, I was so popular that I even had a girl chugging from each hand. I will admit that it was flattering at first, but when I realised that they cared only about my beer hands and the chugging and not about me as a person, I just had to put the caps back on.

That was in no way a metaphor for something else. I am not that deep, ok? I have beers for hands.

You would think that having beers for hands would make life easier, and sometimes it does. For one thing, they're really good icebreakers. Yes, when there's a situation that calls for some icebreaking, beer hands really come in handy (heh). Flesh hands, unless you are some kind of taichi expert, usually get hurt when you slam them hard onto ice. Ice breaks flesh hands. Beer hands, however, generally get the job done. There was this one time when a speeding iceberg almost hit a cruise ship I happened to be on. The crew just tied me to the prow and made me hold my beer hands in front of the ship. The iceberg broke in half as it charged towards us. Everybody was cheering. Man, I really broke the ice that day.

However, when I grew tired of the fame that comes with being a champion ice breaker and decided to become a serious computer programmer, i.e. someone who computer programs seriously, the beer hands became a hindrance. It is very hard to type properly when you are shitfaced all the time. Now, I know what you are thinking. I am not an alcoholic, so please stop judging me. I drink beer instead of any other beverage, not because I like it, but because you cannot hold a cup with beer hands. I cannot even eat normal food without assistance. As you can imagine, my constantly inebriated state makes typing properly, a vital skill for a serious computer programmer, a considerable challenge.

To this day, people ask me how I managed to do it, but I just hit them on the head with my beer hand to avoid answering that question. My boss, in particular, keeps asking me what I am doing in the company. Well, actually, he asks me when I will leave, but he is suffering multiple concussions right now and cannot really hear my answer. It seems some scoundrel pushed him into the path of a charging iceberg. Since he was not born with beer hands, he could not defend himself. I hope he recovers soon, and asks less questions when he does.
![Manga wife](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ce598dae-25fc-4695-85da-3d948236cd17.jpg)

That is my wife, who is a manga. When we met, I thought that we had nothing in common. She was literally two-dimensional and monochromatic, while I had beer hands and broke ice professionally. I have often tried to dissect the nature of the attraction between us. It could not be the chugging, because two-dimensional creatures could not chug. I still have no answer. When we go out together, we will often hear people talking about us behind our backs and in front of our faces, but not to our sides, because mangas have no depth and cannot be perceived visually from the side. When I was younger and full of false pride, I used to want to roll her up and carry her in my pocket, unrolling her only when we were alone. It was difficult, however, for a guy with beer hands to roll up a human-sized manga, so I had to give up the idea.

Later, however, I grew a little defiant at society.

"Who are they?" I would rail as I waved my beer hands drunkenly about.

"Who are they to judge our love? Are mangas not also people? If you prick them, do they not bleed?"

No, they do not. Mangas do not have blood. Still, who are they indeed? I think who you love is exclusively your own business. I love my wife because even though she is a manga, she is a good person. I think the world could do with more manga-beer hand couples.
