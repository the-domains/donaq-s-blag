I think the decision for the modest goal of blagging at least 100 words a day was a good one. It is very achievable, so there is no pressure and hence very little resistance against starting this task. _Hey_, my subconscious usually says, _let's just bang out 100 words and get on with our lives_. _How hard can it be?_

So my lazy arse begrudgingly starts typing and then usually I find it really hard to keep to within the 100 word limit. Incidentally, I just noticed that "blagging" does not trigger that annoying red jagged underline that signifies a spelling error, and I [looked it up][0]. Apparently, it is British slang for either robbing or conning something from someone. Here's what Google tells us:

> blag  
> 
> /blaÉ¡/
> 
> BRITISH
> 
> informal_
> 
> verb_
> 
> gerund or present participle:**blagging**
> 
> 1. manage to obtain (something) by using persuasion or guile.
> 
> "they blagged two free tickets to France"
> 2. steal (something) in a violent robbery or raid.
> 
> "I could lie in wait and blag her fur coat"

That works for me. This blag is both a blog and a con. I am, in effect, using this blag to blag myself into practicing my writing skills.

By blagging.
